## About me
The experience of my past work helps me to develop now. Or why am I studying: 

I worked as an environmental engineer. This taught me: working with customers, creating projects, working on non-standard deadlines, the ability to quickly study information and apply it. As well as experience in independent decision-making.

My second place of work: support in the support service. She gave me __great stress tolerance__, experience in informal communication with users, solving various non-standard tasks.
